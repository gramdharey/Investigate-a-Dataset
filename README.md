# UDACITY-Investigate-a-Dataset
## Project: tmdb-movies Data Analysis

This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue. 
In this report, the data analysis process will be used to answer the following questions:

     ● What is the relationship between runtime and vote average?
     ● What is the correlation between vote average, popularity and release year
     ● What is the yearly revenue change?
     ● Checking the percantage distribution of the genre.


Some of these columns would neither take a new shape and dimensions as well as get deleted if not needed.
The final two columns ending with “_adj” show the budget and revenue of the associated movie in terms of 2010 dollars, accounting for inflation over time

This analysis will use some libaries of Python including Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
